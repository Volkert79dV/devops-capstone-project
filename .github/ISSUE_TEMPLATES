**As a** user  
**I need** an account microservice
**So that** I can keep track of the customers on my e-commerce website  
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * Someone else has already started to work on this and has developed a Python Flask based Rest API with an endpoint to create a customer account
      * The service exists and has a well formed REST API that other microservices can call
      * The main service needs to be able to create, read, update, delete and list customers

### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given that I created a new customer in the microservice
    When I look up the new customer in microservice
    Then the customer should be listed

    Given That I look up an existing customer
    When I look up the existing customer and access the record with read-access
    Then I will be able to read the data behind the record But I will not be able to modify the customer

    Given That I look up an existing customer
    When I update the customer name
    Then The customer name should be updated if I list it And the old customer name should no longer be present.

    Given That I look up an existing customer
    When I delete the customer record
    Then The customer record should no longer show up if I search for it again.

    Given That the microservice contains three customers
    When I ask to list all customers using a wildcard "*" search
    Then the microservice should list all 3 customers

### You have been asked by the customer account manager at your company to develop an account microservice to keep track of the customers on your e-commerce website. Since it is a microservice, it is expected to have a well-formed REST API that other microservices can call. This service initially needs to create, read, update, delete, and list customers.
### You have also been told that someone else has started on this task. They have already developed the database model and a Python Flask-based REST API with an endpoint to create a customer account. You just need to plan to add the REST APIs to read, update, delete, and list accounts. Since you will be working in an online lab environment, you will need to plan your work to get that environment ready for development.
